<FONT FACE="CENTURY">
<P>Anjali Patekar arrives in Mumbai looking for a job. She finds cheap lodging by feigning marriage to a stranger, Nandu Apte, an aspiring musician. Jitendra "Jeetu" Sahai has just started his own electronics business. His friend Anil Singh pretends to be millionaire businessman Radhe Shyam Tiwari's son and conspires with his servant Pandu to trick Kachra Seth into a quick engagement with his daughter Madhuri. At the same time, Radhe Shyam Tiwari, who lives in a village with his wife Anjali Tiwari moves to the city. With news of Radhe's arrival, Pandu asks Anil to abscond.<BR>

Anjali goes to Radhe's villa hoping for a job. At this point, Jeetu shows up at the villa to fix a stereo he sold to Radhe. Seeing Anjali at the door, he mistakes her for Radhe's daughter. Unable to land a job at the Radhe's, Anjali later bumps into Jeetu when she responds to a vacancy at his store. Already trying to woo Anjali for assuming her to be Radhe's daughter, Jeetu hires her readily. Afraid of losing the job, Anjali continues the pretense.<BR>
Every day after work, Jeetu drops Anjali off at Radhe's villa believing she lives there with Anjali exiting the villa after Jeetu leaves. With Jeetu often showing up at Tiwari's villa asking for Anjali and Mrs. Tiwari spotting the real Anjali frequently outside the villa, the Tiwari become convinced that each is having an affair with the younger counterparts.<BR>

Nandu has begun to fall in love with his room-mate Anjali. Also, Nandu's landlord's wife has fallen for him, and is after him about eloping with her. In a misunderstanding over the phone, Jeetu assumes Anjali loves him. Meanwhile, her village landlord's son Raja arrives the city to marry Anjali but Nandu scares Raja away. Raja hides in the same lodge as Anil. Agitated by Anil absconding, Kachra Seth visits Radhe for Madhuri's wedding to Anil.<BR>

All the major characters start chasing after each other and end up in a warehouse, where a big melee follows. Ending the Ruckus (Hungama), Jeetu and Nandu confront Anjali and profess their love for her, forcing her to choose between them. The film ends with Anjali choosing Nandu and Jeetu wishing them the best.
